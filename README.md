# events_manager
An event management system that uses files that contain information about an upcoming event and will put them into an organized table in MYSQL. 
In addition, the program uses MYSQL to show the user information about the events/take actions on them :) 
(such as deleting them from the table or showing witch is the first upcoming event ect.)
